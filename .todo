* cgi-bin is necessary and insecure.
* `include` and `php` seem to house the same stuff, in two separate places.
* Form sanitization seems to happen client-side.

Lets not concern ourselves with the horrifically out of date MySQL and PHPMyAdmin, but Apache and PHP are important.
PHPMyAdmin 2.11.9.5 => 4.2.9
MySQL 5.0.67 => 5.6

* Images don't have proper alternative texts, which is bad for accessibility.
